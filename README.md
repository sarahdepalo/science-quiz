# Science Pop Quiz!

This quiz featuring Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson was built while following along with this awesome [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2JCjVSZlG0). TypeScript is a language that I've been wanting to learn and this was my first dabble with it, so I still have a ways to go until I feel comfortable writing and using it by myself. 

API used in the tutorial and this project: [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
